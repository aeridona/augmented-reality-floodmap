This floodmap was created by Jennefer Campoverde and Tess Bergman, utilizing datasets courtesy of Floodsense. We will be relying on openstreetmap data and the Street View API to build the 2D and 3D map component details seperately, and will provide framework for a virtual reality flooding simulation based on the user's location and proximity to a sensor (throwing an exception if the user is more than 25 miles from the nearest sensor.)
