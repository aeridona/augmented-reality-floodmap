This floodmap was created by Jennefer Campoverde and Tess Bergman, utilizing datasets courtesy of Floodsense. We will be relying on openstreetmap data and A-Frame to build the 2D and 3D map component details seperately, and will provide framework for a virtual reality flooding simulation based on the user's location and proximity to a sensor (throwing an exception if the user is more than 25 miles from the nearest sensor.)
